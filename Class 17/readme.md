# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## AWS S3

Object storage built to retrieve any amount of data from anywhere

### How it works

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service. Customers of all sizes and industries can store and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case. With cost-effective storage classes and easy-to-use management features, you can optimize costs.

### Use cases

- Build a data lake

    Run big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and high performance computing (HPC) applications to unlock data insights.

- Back up and restore critical data

    Meet Recovery Time Objectives (RTO), Recovery Point Objectives (RPO), and compliance requirements with S3’s robust replication features.

- Archive data at the lowest cost

    Move data archives to the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes to lower costs, eliminate operational complexities, and gain new insights.

- Run cloud-native applications

    Build fast, powerful mobile and web-based cloud-native apps that scale automatically in a highly available configuration.

## AWS Lambda

### What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services. The concept of "serverless" computing refers to not needing to maintain your own servers to run these functions. AWS Lambda takes care of all the infrastructure for you, so that you can focus on writing code.

### How does AWS Lambda work?

Each Lambda function runs in its own container on a multi-tenant cluster of machines. Customers don't get much visibility into how the system operates, but they don't need to worry about updating the underlying machines.

### Why is AWS Lambda an essential part of the Serverless architecture?

    The stack you'll need to complete a Serverless stack includes components such as Docker, Amazon's JIRA and Facebook's P2P services.

complete a Serverless stack you’ll need:

- a computing service.
- a database service.
- an HTTP gateway service.

### What are the most common use cases for AWS Lambda?

Due to Lambda’s architecture, it can deliver great benefits over traditional cloud computing setups for applications where:

- individual tasks run for a short time;
- each task is generally self-contained;
- there is a large difference between the lowest and highest levels in the workload of the application.

Different parts of the API can be routed to different Lambda functions via Amazon API Gateway. AWS Lambda automatically scales individual functions according to the demand for them, so different parts of your API can scale differently.

### Supported languages and runtimes

Node.js 8.10
Node.js 10.x (normally the latest LTS version from the 10.x series)
Node.js 12.x (normally the latest LTS version from the 12.x series)
Python 2.7
Python 3.6
Python 3.7
Python 3.8
Ruby 2.5
Java 8 - This includes JVM-based languages that can run on Java 8’s JVM — the latest Clojure 1.10 and Scala 2.12 both run on Java 8 so can be used with AWS Lambda
Java 11
Go 1.x (latest release)
C# — .NET Core 1.0
C# — .NET Core 2.1
PowerShell Core 6.0

### Benefits of using AWS Lambda

With Lambda, you don't need to worry about maintaining your own servers. Instead, you pay per use for the compute and network traffic generated by your functions.

## CDN : Content Delivery Network (CDN)

![](https://cyberhoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-is-Content-Delivery-Network-768x485.jpg)

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. CDNs allow for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, stylesheets, images, and videos.

### What does this mean for an SMB?

CDNs are something that larger companies are more likely to implement. DDoS attacks are rarely used against SMB's unless they upset a hacker group. CyberHoot's best advice to an SMB is to know what a CDN is, and establish a relationship with a vendor without paying for protection.
