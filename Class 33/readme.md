## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization. RBAC is one of the main methods for advanced access control. Using RBAC will help in securing your company's sensitive data and important applications. The roles in RBAC refer to levels of access that employees have to the network.

## BENEFITS OF RBAC

With RBAC, you can reduce the need for paperwork and password changes when an employee is hired or changes their role. RBAC helps to more easily integrate third-party users into your network by giving them pre-defined roles. It also reduces the potential for error when assigning user permissions.

## BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTING RBAC

A core business function of any organization is protecting data. An RBAC system can ensure the company's information meets privacy and confidentiality regulations. It can secure key business processes, including access to IP, that affect the business from a competitive standpoint. Implementing a RBAC shouldn't happen without a great deal of consideration.
