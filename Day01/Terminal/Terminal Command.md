## Q1 The Command Line - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one?

### -The command line is a text-based interface within the operating system, that forwards commands from the user to the operating system,also display issuing commands,also running a programme from your command line.(ls used to list the contents of the directory or directories)(the function of the “echo” command is to display a string (piece of text) on the console. )

## Q2 Basic Navigation - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around i?

### - A lot of the commands on the device depend on you being in the right place, for that we use the command to remind yourself of where you are now

### - (pwd (print working directory) shows the current directory (basically, the folder) you’re in)(~ (tilde)a shortcut for your home directory)(. (dot)a reference to your current directory)(.. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory)(cd [location])

### - (Relative path : A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system. /Absolute path :A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.)

----------------

## Q3 More About Files - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment?

### - Everything is actually a file and it doesn't affect what we do very much but helps understand Linux behavior as we manage files and directories

### - Terminal sees all kindest of files as distinct and separate files but the case sensitivity when dealing with command line options must be careful , also the spaces between the words

### - directory's name begins with a . (full stop) then it is considered to be hidden and the command "ls" will not insert it

### - file obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is

### - ls -a List the contents of a directory, including hidden files

## Q4 Manual Pages - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning

### -Manual pages are a group of pages that explain every command available on your system with full functions. You can invoke the manual pages with the following command

### -It is possible to perform a keyword search on the directory pages

### - (man `<command>`) Look up the manual page for a particular command

### - (man -k `<search term>`) Do a keyword search for all manual pages containing the given search term

### - (`/<term>`) Within a manual page, perform a search for 'term'

### - (n)After performing a search within a manual page, select the next found item

## Q5 File Manipulation - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories

### - There is no command line undo on Linux (Linux GUI desktop environments usually provide an undo feature but the command line does not)

### - (mkdir)  is short for Make Directory to (create a file)

### - (rmdir) to remove a directory ,it is short for remove directory

### - (rm) Remove - ie. Delete a file

### - (-p) which tells (mkdir) to make master directories as needed

### - (-v) which makes (mkdir) tell us what to do

### - (touch) : Create a blank file

### - (cp) Copy - ie. Copy a file or directory , Make a duplicate of a file or directory before changing something we can use the command we use for this is cp which is short for copy

### - (mv) to Move - ie. Move a file or directory (can also be used to rename),It works in a similar way to cp but we can move directories without having to provide the -r option

### - (-r) option you mean we want to look at a directory and all the files and directories in it, and for sub-directories, go to it and do the same and keep doing it

## Q6 Cheat Sheet - A quick reference for the main points covered in this tutorial ?

### - It is a wonderful shortcut, especially as it shortens our time, and the commands also solved many things, one of which is that I created all the files manually and attached them to the program, but now it is faster in everything

## Thanks a lot for these information :)
