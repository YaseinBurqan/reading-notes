# AWS: Cloud Servers

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a highly available and secured cloud service platform. Almost every company use AWS services. I recorded a short tutorial on Amazon Web Services. Do give it a look and comment if you want additional videos on any other services.

# AWS EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers the broadest and deepest compute platform. More SAP, high performance computing (HPC), ML, and Windows workloads run on AWS than any other cloud. We are the first major cloud provider that supports Intel, AMD, and Arm processors.

1- Run cloud-native and enterprise applications

    Amazon EC2 delivers secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.

2- Scale for HPC applications

    Access the on-demand infrastructure and capacity you need to run HPC applications faster and cost-effectively.

3- Develop for Apple platforms

    Build, test, and sign on-demand macOS workloads. Access environments in minutes, dynamically scale capacity as needed, and benefit from AWSâ€™s pay-as-you-go pricing

4- Train and deploy ML applications

    Amazon EC2 delivers the broadest choice of compute, networking (up to 400 Gbps), and storage services purpose-built to optimize price performance for ML projects.

# EC2 For Humans

AWS (Amazon Web Service) is a cloud computing platform that enables users to access on demand computing services like database storage, virtual cloud server, etc. This online course will give an in-depth knowledge on EC2 instance as well as useful strategy on how to build and modify instance.

S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. It allows the users to store and retrieve various types of data using API calls. Amazon Cloud-front is responsible for content delivery, i.e. used to deliver website. Requests for content at the user's end are automatically routed to the nearest edge location. AWS Elastic Load Balancing can dynamically grow and shrink the load-balancing capacity as per the traffic conditions. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) provides a similar access as that of Oracle, or Microsoft's SQL Server database engine.

# Elastic Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications. You can simply upload your code and it automatically handles the deployment. At the same time, you retain full control over the Amazon Web Services resources powering your application.
